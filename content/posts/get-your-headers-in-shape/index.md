Today is 1st of January, and as I write this, the weather
[outside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27s-Hertogenbosch) is
dreadful.

It was then that, while browsing away, I stumbled upon a pull request
from fellow programmer and good friend

[club](https://512kb.club/) is yet-another-plea at designing and
implementing more resource-conscious websites. Be that from the
perspective of sustainability or mere engineering efficiency, I concur
