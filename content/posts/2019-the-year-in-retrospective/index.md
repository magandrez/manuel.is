The end of the year is soon upon us. I am not a fan of any new year's resolutions or that sort of stuff, but for the past year and a half I have been dabbling into [stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) and some of its practices.

One of the most common practice is the daily reflection, exercised for example by [journaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary). This has proven for me to be a very powerful tool in all aspects of life.

So, I wanted to mix daily reflections and the concept of [*zeitgeist*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist), to review some topics I have touched during 2019. Below, a list in no particular order:

**Photography**  :camera: -- This has been a busy year for me when it comes to photography. This year has been about testing things and finding my way. I realised that rushing to publish material does not bring me anything, and I don't need to please anybody but myself. I am comfortable with this line of thought and it will probably lead me to change the way I edit and publish my material, but I have not yet decided how or when. 

I did a lot of experiments with my flow: from just processing JPGs, to exporting RAWs to a tablet and processing the files with different software like [Darkroom](https://darkroom.co/) or [Ultralight](http://www.ultralightapp.com/) (this last one made in Finland). On the same line, I have researched for what should become my go-to editing tool, having discarded Adobe products for their license and in line with my views, I have opted for [RawTherapee](https://rawtherapee.com/). Next year I will continue mastering my tools further (software and hardware), gaining confidence at doing portraits and focus on finding out what I really want to photograph.

I even built my own personal cloud system with [NextCloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nextcloud) installed on top of a tiny-but-extremely-powerful [Rock64](https://www.pine64.org/devices/single-board-computers/rock64/) attached to a 4TB disk; a home-made NAS/cloud, if you will, that end up discarded due to the subpar uplink provided by my ISP.

**Code** :computer: -- This year I have grown quite a bit my knowledge in certain areas. Because of professional reasons, I have worked quite a lot with Ruby and a little bit with Golang. On my part time, I have decided at the beginning of the year to start learning [Bash with Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/bash). But then it dawn on me: allmost all I play with is object-oriented. Because of this, and my growing love affair with Emacs, I decided to start digging into Elisp, and here I am, half way through [An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html), happy and excited with the possibilities. But then, a colleague pitched to me Erlang, and I found it super powerful and, since it shares paradigm with Elisp, I thought why not? so I took over [Learn You Some Erlang](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/) (thanks Larte!). My aim is to not take anything else, go deeper with what I have already started and see where that leads me.

**Books** :books: -- I have failed myself here. At the beginning of this year, I proposed myself two goals:

- To **read only books authored by women** and (if possible) from different countries.
- To **read my first novel in Finnish**.

For the former, everything started very well, with [Riot Days by Maria Alyokhina](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/306/306607/riot-days/9780141986616.html) as one of my favourite books of the past 5 years (go read it if you have not!). However, towards the middle of the challenge, I started to make exceptions (e.g.: with all technical books mentioned above are written by males) and then I failed at being consistent and started to read other subjects authored by males. 

For the later, I decided to reduce the average amount of books I read during a year --around 30-- to half of that, plus one, to make room for my pace understanding Finnish. Here I failed again, as I did not manage to settle on which book to read, and so I went ahead and just read English and Spanish literature without stopping to select a good Finnish novel to read other than Tove Jansson's works which I have already read and don't count as novel, but more teenage literature. You can find out everything I read from [my Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/spav).

**Leisure** :bicyclist: -- Fun was had, indeed. With my new bike I had fun on a solo 400km trip. Hiking the Finnish fjells short after with my dog Aarre was also a bliss. I was rather inconsistent at practicing some sort of physical activity for a sustained period of time (i.e. more than 6 months). I stopped my mysore practice due to fatigue, I stopped swimming out of boredom and I interrupted running because of the weather. Looking forward for getting on my bike in 2020.

**Doggy** :dog: Aarre is the best thing that has happened to me in 2019. Hands down. He makes me so happy!. I am super glad I came across him and I could provide him home, food and entertainment. Remember to [adopt, don't shop](https://www.caninejournal.com/adopt-dont-shop/).

I have it clear now, I am failing to follow up on things :see_no_evil: Well, at least I know what I need to work on.

I recommend this or any other kind of reflection if you are trying to get deeper into the _whys_ and be systematic when going about things. I could start by updating this site more often...
