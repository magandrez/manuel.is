I am not a person with ~much~ any attachment to new years' resolutions and things
of the sort. It is well known that there are [many
calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_calendars), ours is just one of
the many, so I feel that nowadays, most of the people give too much importance
to this arbitrary division of time.

But one thing I still do every year comes January 1st, is to set my reading
goal in [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/), for no particular reason than
to keep me motivated, because seeing the goal completion percentage increasing
throughout the year is, believe it or not, soothing. In the end, humans are not
far from lab rats, seeking for dope after performing a task. And so, I wrote off
2024 as a disastrous reading year for many reasons that don't belong here, and I
set about going back to my normal reading pace and interests, I logged into the
service and updated my reading challenge. Like any other year.

But it was just a few days later that _The Orange Twat_ took office, and in a
theatrical show of power, he decided to sit a bunch of oligarch _tech bros_ in
the front row of his inauguration (comically, ahead of his own aides). My
partner, as most of the world, took notice of such, and upon commenting it, made
the remark that it is outrageous for us to continue relying on the services
these people use to become even more rich, specially for some services that are
not necessarily critical. And so, two days after, my partner was out of
Goodreads.

I know very well that there's been an alternative out there for while (6 years,
to be precise): [The StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/). By many
standards it is better than Goodreads, even for its short life. The statistics,
the flexibility on book tagging and cataloguing, its simplicity, the focus on
tracking your reads, etc. I knew it
from few years back, when I first tested, but somehow, similarly as it happens
with the balkanization of [IM
protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols),
_I did not want to jump into another service and leave my friends behind_. But
this time, my partner's words resonated stronger than before given the context
we are in.

If there is anything, for small the gesture might be, the times are proving
that we must do it. We must take every chance to send the message that we don't
want to be part of their machinery. Even if it is just taking our reading data
away from a service. And hope that other people will do the same, after all, the
effect of explaining (here or in person) why I am moving away from
an Amazon-centric service is more important than any (non-existing) monetary
loss that I might cause to Jeff.

And so, here it is my (for now public) [profile in
StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/spav).

It was only _after_ I did the switch, that I learned the [person behind
StoryGraph is Nadia
Odunayo](https://peopleofcolorintech.com/articles/black-woman-founded-reading-app-storygraph-temporarily-taken-offline-after-surge-in-popularity/),
a black woman who I think is also deeply involved
in the software behind it, at least judging by the updates in the [publicly
available roadmap](https://roadmap.thestorygraph.com/).

Thank you, Nadia, for your work üëè.
