We are well into the second month of 2023, but I still want to record what have
caught my eyes and ears in the past year.

**Music**

My [past year's scrobbling
history](https://www.last.fm/user/Spav/listening-report/year "Spav's Last.fm
report for 2022") shows something clearly: the global pandemic took its toll
on the amount of hours of music I listened in 2022. In my case, the amount
shrank and I blame for it not being able to attend live gigs, and thus my
appetite decreasing. I also found myself revisiting carefully, album by album
things like Led Zeppelin, and more recently Pink Floyd. I suppose these are
early signs of a middle age crisis of sorts.

But if I am to highlight a discovery, that would
be [Malamute](https://www.last.fm/music/Malamute "Last.fm entry of Malamute
band") and [Ginebras](https://www.last.fm/music/Ginebras "Last.fm entry of
Ginebras band") (thanks [@bertogg](https://floss.social/@berto "@bertogg in
Mastodon")!).

Although not as visible in my Last.fm profile, I have listened to music genres I
have not listened before before, people like
[Bejo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjyGIz9NUpW_Vjh5p9Py_Hg "Bejo's channel
in Youtube") a guy from Canary Islands whose use of Spanish language is
mesmerizing.

**Books**

Last year was my first not reaching my goal of reading a certain amount of books
within the year. Not sure why, to be honest, but likely the extended time I
spent outdoors might be to blame.

One book and author rose above all: [Adrienne
Buller](https://jacobin.com/author/adrienne-buller "Adrienne's articles in
Jacobin magazine") and her _[The Value of a Whale: On the Illusions of Green
Capitalism](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/24/how-whales-can-help-dispel-the-myth-of-green-capitalism-adrienne-buller
"Review of 'The Value of a Whale' on The Guardian")_. Reading it was a definitive
eye-opening experience. Adrienne brings an engaging narrative and good combination of
analysis and synthesis to dissect the global capitalist society we take part on
and how we are confronting the climate crisis.

**Series**

Many people have cheered _The White Lotus_. Yes, the second season was definitely
good, specially with regards to character development. But that aside, I took a
dive back in time and revisited _Parks & Recreation_. What a good series it was!,
and how full of details every episode is!.

**Movies**

I had the opportunity to watch _[As
Bestas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beasts_(2022_film) "'As Bestas' entry
about the movie in Wikipedia")_ already back in September, and I liked how the
story was told and the characters and cast, and it seems it got [good
praise](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-beasts-cannes-review/5171267.article
"Review of 'The Beasts' in Screen Daily"). But for me, the best came one of the
last days of the year: _[Triangle of
Sadness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDvfFIZQIuQ "'Triangle of Sadness'
trailer in Youtube")_ is a masterpiece of satire that connects directly with the
topic I have been interested in for the past few years. And what an act does
Woody Harrelson put up.

This year, as the pandemic seems to be receding, I am hoping to experience
plenty more of live gigs, movies and other such events. I'll make a mental note
and record those here.
