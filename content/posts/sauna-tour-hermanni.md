As I have stated [earlier](https://manuel.is/posts/cul-de-sac/), my journey at
Compensate, as that of others, came to an abrupt end in May. But I admit it, I
am in a very priviledged position: figuring out my future (professionally)
required just a bit of patience, due diligence and finding out where I could
help. It was a matter of time. 

And so, once my future was cleared (more on that some other day), I had plenty
of time in my hands, so I did what every other wise person would do, ~~I used it
wisely~~ I procrastinated.

While trying to figure out how I could better spend my time and relax for the
upcoming _gig_, my partner had a good suggestion:_"why don't you try all the
saunas around?"_ was their suggestion. So this is how the _"Helsinki Sauna Tour"_
came to be. I will make a review of each and all of the public saunas in
Helsinki and publish it here as a post during this Fall. First stop: Hermanni.

#### Hermanni

As my first sauna sample in the tour I decided to start by one I have never been
to before: [Sauna
Hermanni](https://www.saunahermanni.fi/). 

As the name hints, this sauna is
located in the [Hermanni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermanni_(Helsinki))
neighborhood, part of the Vallila district. Its name comes from a _free lord_ (?)
named Herman Sigfrid Standertskjöld-Nordenstam, who owned a manor —[Kumpulan
kartano]()— in the area.

Moving on in time, the neighborhood came to be dominated by a large complex that
served as abattoir from 1933 all the way to 1992, which, given how relatively
_centric_ this neighborhood is, feels quite shocking. After the murdering of
innocent animals for meat stopped, the area turned into a lively complex
hosting restaurants, cafés and even a local distillery of strong alcohol.

In the late nineties, _gentrification_ came knocking at the door, but the prices
for housing space were already quite high by the time the refurbishment was
completed, something not suprising given Hermanni is bordering with Kallio and
its sky-high rents.

**The sauna**

With a tram stop nearby, several bus stops close by and conveniently located in
the upper part of _Hämeentie_ (one of the main arteries of the city), accessing
Sauna Hermanni by public transport, on foot or by bike, as I did, is fairly
easy.

The sauna is capable of hosting 30 men and 20 women (separately) with a mixed
shift on Thursdays. It is nicely maintained, claiming they've been in business
since the 50s (!). It is an electric-heated sauna and the feeling I got was that
of a bit dry sauna (typical from the electric-heated ones), although this
perception might have been due to having entered the sauna a bit late with not
so many customers having thrown enough steam at regular intervals before me.

One of the things that grabbed my attention was the pricing. Be it thanks to a
class-conscious ownership, a good marketing stunt or a reminder of the times when
their clientele were mainly local workforce with limited resources, *accessing
the sauna can be made at a discounted price for unemployed people*. This was a
perk that I was happy to find out.

The facilities are stuffed with memorabilia from different decades, from old
newspapers, to Super8 film cameras hanging from the walls, old
magazines, and aside from the out-of-place-and-time cover girls, the changing
room feels like a small museum worth a visit. The time between sauna shifts can
be spent sipping a beverage and browsing said magazines or outdoors in the small
courtyard, covered from peering eyes by a cute vine and chatting away with other
sauna-goers.

Very recommendable, and a very good start to my _Helsinki Sauna Tour_.
