My name is Manuel González. I am originally from [Galiza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain)) (_/ɡaˈliθɐ/_), in the north-west of Spain. I am a Software Engineer, and I like to work with backend technologies. :earth_africa:
 
If you want to see some code I have written, you can visit my [GitHub account](https://github.com/magandrez "github.com/magandrez") or check my [Exercism.io profile](https://exercism.io/profiles/magandrez).  :computer:

On the interwebs, I go by `magandrez` (my full name _rehashed_), `spavi` or `spav`.

When I am not coding or walking with my dog _Aarre_, I can be seen taking photos on the streets of [Helsinki](https://www.myhelsinki.fi/en "MyHelsinki is the entry portal for Helsinki's events.") (Finland), where I live. :camera:

If you are interested in my photography, you can see some of my photos in my Instagram account [@spavi](https://www.instagram.com/spavi/ "@spavi in Instagram"). Some others might appear in this website.
